					<h3>Adaptive cruise control modeling and field experiments</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This project explores methods for model parameter estimation on a car-following model using data collected from Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) enabled vehicles. The proposed methods are batch method least-squares and an online particle filter. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and computational performance of the methods relative to a commonly used simulation-based optimization approach. The methods are also assessed on empirical data collected from a 2019 model year ACC vehicle driven in a highway environment. Speed, space gap, and relative velocity data are recorded directly from the factory-installed radar unit via the vehicleâ€™s CAN bus. The least-squares method has the fastest run-time performance, and is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than other methods. The particle filter is faster than real-time, and therefore is suitable in streaming applications in which the datasets can grow arbitrarily large.</p>

					<h3>Automatic data cleaning via tensor factorization for large urban environmental sensor networks</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency identifies that urban heat islands can negatively impact a communityâ€™s environment and quality of life. Using low cost urban sensing networks, it is possible to measure the impacts of mitigation strategies in communities at a fine-grained scale, informing context-aware policies and infrastructure design. However, fine-grained city-scale data analysis is complicated by common, tedious data cleaning tasks such as removing outliers and imputing missing data. To address the challenge of data cleaning, this article introduces a robust low-rank tensor factorization method to automatically correct anomalies and impute missing entries for high-dimensional urban environmental datasets. We validate the method on a synthetically degraded National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration temperature dataset, with a recovery error of 4%, and apply it to the Array of Things city-scale sensor network in Chicago, IL.</p>
