D. from the Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University in September 2023, where I also served as a Research Engineer. I am a five-time recipient of the prestigious Dwight D. Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship awarded by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and was honored as the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Rising Star by the University of Virginia Link Lab in 2023. I held research internship positions at Toyota Infotech Labs and Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), and was a visiting researcher at the Institute for Pure &amp; Applied Mathematics (IPAM) at UCLA.          My research focuses on advancing transportation CPS by developing computationally-efficient tools for generating large-scale empirical data. My work aims to revolutionize traffic monitoring and control for the next generation of transportation systems.                                                Education:                    Ph.

    "body": "2022/08/05 - Vehicle trajectory data has received increasing research attention over the past decades. With the technological sensing improvements such as high-resolution video cameras, in-vehicle radars and lidars, abundant individual and contextual traffic data is now available. However, though the data quantity is massive, it is by itself of limited utility for traffic research because of noise and systematic sensing errors, thus necessitates proper processing to ensure data quality. We draw particular attention to extracting high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from video cameras as traffic monitoring cameras are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. We explore methods for automatic trajectory data reconciliation, given “raw” vehicle detection and tracking information from automatic video processing algorithms. We propose a pipeline including a) an online data association algorithm to match fragments that are associated to the same object (vehicle), which is formulated as a min-cost network flow problem of a graph, and b) a trajectory reconciliation method formulated as a quadratic program to enhance raw detection data. The pipeline leverages vehicle dynamics and physical constraints to associate tracked objects when they become fragmented, remove measurement noise on trajectories and impute missing data due to fragmentations. The accuracy is benchmarked on a sample of manually-labeled data, which shows that the reconciled trajectories improve the accuracy on all the tested input data for a wide range of measures. An online version of the reconciliation pipeline is implemented and will be applied in a continuous video processing system running on a camera network covering a 4-mile stretch of Interstate-24 near Nashville, Tennessee.

However, personalization components, as a mean to make the current technologies more acceptable and trustworthy for users, have been gaining momentum only very recently. In my recent work with Toyota InfoTech Labs, we aim to learn personalized longitudinal driving behaviors via a Gaussian Process (GP) model. The proposed method learns from individual driver’s naturalistic car-following behavior, and outputs a desired acceleration profile that suits the user’s preference. The learned model, together with a predictive safety filter that prevents rear-end collision, is used as a personalized adaptive cruise control (PACC) system. Numerical experiments show that GP-based PACC (GP-PACC) can reproduce the driving styles of human drivers up to 80% more accurately than baseline models (i. e. , optimal velocity model and intelligent driver model). Additionally, GP-PACC is further validated by human-in-the-loop experiments on the Unity game engine-based driving simulator. Trips driven by GP-PACC and two other baseline ACC algorithms with driver override rates are recorded and compared. Results show that all drivers override the GP-PACC less frequently, indicating drivers trust GP-PACC more than other ACC algorithms. "

It generates an acceleration command for the vehicle based, at least in part, on the set of ACC parameters. We also applied a predictive safety filter to the acceleration command to produce a certified acceleration command that has been vetted for safety. It allows control acceleration of the vehicle automatically in accordance with the certified acceleration command to regulate a following distance between a lead vehicle and the vehicle in accordance with the learned vehicle-following behavior of the particular driver.

Autonomous vehicle (AV) research and development has achieved a similar status in terms of money invested, societal excitement, and media coverage as space travel and exploration. At the same time, AV research is not rocket science; it is more complicated: while in itself, an AV is no more complex than a spacecraft, it must reliably interact and communicate with many other agents, particularly humans both inside and outside of the vehicle, much of it in a decentralized fashion. Hence, AVs, and their impact on us humans and our transportation systems, incur some of the most complicated science and engineering challenges that we shall face in the near future. At the same time, there is some disconnect across the various research communities: professional product development is highly opaque, and public expectations and media communications are frequently inaccurate or exaggerated. This long program aims to address these problems by connecting research communities, bridging gaps between theory and practice, exposing software experts to hardware and vice versa, and bringing mathematicians, other scientists, and engineers together to shape the research and development agenda on AVs, both in terms of individual and holistic components. Key mathematical themes in this program are:•  Robustness of machine learning•  Connecting micro and the macro scales•  Reinventing traffic flow theory in a non-local world•  Multi-agents systems, sparse controls, distributed leaders•  Fleet optimization and routing in a fully connected world•  Mathematics of societal impact of AVs "

    "body": "2020/06/18 - The advancement of in-vehicle sensors provides abundant datasets to estimate parameters of car-following models that describe driver behaviors. The question of parameter identifiability of such models (i. e. , whether it is possible to infer its unknown parameters from the experimental data) is a central system analysis question, and yet still remains open. We present both structural and practical parameter identifiability analysis on four common car-following models: (i) the constant-time headway relative-velocity (CTH-RV) model, (ii) the optimal velocity model (OV), (iii) the follow-the-leader model (FTL) and (iv) the intelligent driver model (IDM). The structural identifiability analysis is carried out using a differential geometry approach, which confirms that, in theory, all of the tested car-following systems are structurally locally identifiable, i. e. , the parameters can be uniquely inferred under almost all initial condition and admissible inputs by observing the space gap alone. In a practical setting, we propose an optimization-based numerical direct test to determine parameter identifiability given a specific experimental setup (the specific initial conditions and input are known). The direct test conclusively finds distinct parameters under which the CTH-RV and FTL are not identifiable under the given initial condition and input trajectory. "

However, fine-grained city-scale data analysis is complicated by common, tedious data cleaning tasks such as removing outliers and imputing missing data. To address the challenge of data cleaning, this article introduces a robust low-rank tensor factorization method to automatically correct anomalies and impute missing entries for high-dimensional urban environmental datasets. We validate the method on a synthetically degraded National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration temperature dataset, with a recovery error of 4%, and apply it to the Array of Things city-scale sensor network in Chicago, IL.

The methods are also assessed on empirical data collected from a 2019 model year ACC vehicle driven in a highway environment. Speed, space gap, and relative velocity data are recorded directly from the factory-installed radar unit via the vehicle’s CAN bus. The least-squares method has the fastest run-time performance, and is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than other methods. The particle filter is faster than real-time, and therefore is suitable in streaming applications in which the datasets can grow arbitrarily large. "

The chapter later changed the name to Engineers in Action Bridge Program.
