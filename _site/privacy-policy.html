    "body": "2023/11/12 - The Tennessee Department of Transportation’s I-24 Mobility Technology Interstate Observation Network (MOTION) is a four-mile section of I-24 in the Nashville-Davidson County Metropolitan area with 294 ultra-high definition cameras. Those images are converted into a digital model of how every vehicle behaves with unparalleled detail. This is all done anonymously using Artificial Intelligence (AI) trajectory algorithms developed by Vanderbilt University. Vehicle trajectory data allows us to uncover new insights into how traffic flow influences individual vehicle behavior. This groundbreaking understanding of traffic is more important than ever due to the increasing automation capability of individual vehicles, which are beginning to influence traffic flow through their interactions with conventional vehicles. By unlocking a new understanding of how these vehicles influence traffic, vehicle and infrastructure design can be optimized to reduce traffic concerns in the future to improve safety, air quality, and fuel efficiency. The purpose of I-24 MOTION is to provide an environment for testing advanced traffic management and automated vehicle technologies in real freeway traffic. Automakers and suppliers are investing billions of dollars in adding connectivity and automation features to vehicles, forever changing safety and mobility. These technologies are often developed in the laboratory or closed-course settings. Testing in traffic captures the variability of real-world conditions and human behavior. Complementary congestion management technologies are being installed by TDOT along this same section of interstate as part of the I-24 SMART Corridor project. Read more about the I-24 MOTION project from TDOT. Using the information gathered on this testbed, I-24 MOTION will provide insights to allow the industry to build better products and allow TDOT to better understand how to make the most out of these products for managing infrastructure assets. The first testbed user is the U. S. Department of Energy’s sponsored research with the CIRCLES Consortium, which is studying the possibility of smoothing traffic by introducing vehicles equipped with advanced driver-assist systems. The poles tower more than 100 feet high and are equipped with at least six high definition cameras. The roughly 300 video feeds will provide researchers with data about how vehicles interact with each other on the road.

    "body": "2023/09/12 - Multi-object tracking (MOT) or global data association problem is commonly approached as a minimum-cost-flow or minimum-cost-circulation problem on a graph. While there have been numerous studies aimed at enhancing algorithm efficiency, most of them focus on the batch problem, where all the data must be available simultaneously to construct a static graph. However, with the growing number of applications that generate streaming data, an efficient online algorithm is required to handle the streaming nature of the input. In this paper, we present an online extension of the well-known negative cycle canceling algorithm for solving the multi-object tracking problem with streaming fragmented data. We provide a proof of correctness for the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency through numerical experiments.

With the technological sensing improvements such as high-resolution video cameras, in-vehicle radars and lidars, abundant individual and contextual traffic data is now available. However, though the data quantity is massive, it is by itself of limited utility for traffic research because of noise and systematic sensing errors, thus necessitates proper processing to ensure data quality.  YouTube: I-24 MOTION data postprocessing algorithms We draw particular attention to extracting high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from video cameras as traffic monitoring cameras are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. We explore methods for automatic trajectory data reconciliation, given “raw” vehicle detection and tracking information from automatic video processing algorithms. We propose a pipeline including a) an online data association algorithm to match fragments that are associated to the same object (vehicle), which is formulated as a min-cost network flow problem of a graph, and b) a trajectory reconciliation method formulated as a quadratic program to enhance raw detection data. The pipeline leverages vehicle dynamics and physical constraints to associate tracked objects when they become fragmented, remove measurement noise on trajectories and impute missing data due to fragmentations. The accuracy is benchmarked on a sample of manually-labeled data, which shows that the reconciled trajectories improve the accuracy on all the tested input data for a wide range of measures. An online version of the reconciliation pipeline is implemented and will be applied in a continuous video processing system running on a camera network covering a 4-mile stretch of Interstate-24 near Nashville, Tennessee.

We consider three enhanced variations of thebootstrap PF to improve estimation. The benchmark PF utilises a deterministicpartial differential equation and an additive process noise that is state-independent. For the enhanced variations we first consider a parameter-adaptive PF that alsoallows model parameters to be adjusted. The second variation is a standard PFwith spatially-correlated noise. The last variation combines parameter-adaptive andthe spatially-correlated-noise approaches. We compare the four filters in numericalexperiments that represent complex heterogeneous traffic scenarios, as well as onreal-world heterogeneous traffic data. The results show that the enhanced filters canachieve up to an 80% and 46% of accuracy improvement as compared to an openloop simulation without measurement correction, with the synthetic settings andwith real traffic data, respectively. Moreover, the enhanced filters outperform thestandard PF in all the traffic scenarios based on accuracy. Resources:  Estimation for heterogeneous traffic using enhanced particle filters"

However, personalization components, as a mean to make the current technologies more acceptable and trustworthy for users, have been gaining momentum only very recently. In my recent work with Toyota InfoTech Labs, we aim to learn personalized longitudinal driving behaviors via a Gaussian Process (GP) model. The proposed method learns from individual driver’s naturalistic car-following behavior, and outputs a desired acceleration profile that suits the user’s preference. The learned model, together with a predictive safety filter that prevents rear-end collision, is used as a personalized adaptive cruise control (PACC) system. Numerical experiments show that GP-based PACC (GP-PACC) can reproduce the driving styles of human drivers up to 80% more accurately than baseline models (i. e. , optimal velocity model and intelligent driver model). Additionally, GP-PACC is further validated by human-in-the-loop experiments on the Unity game engine-based driving simulator. Trips driven by GP-PACC and two other baseline ACC algorithms with driver override rates are recorded and compared. Results show that all drivers override the GP-PACC less frequently, indicating drivers trust GP-PACC more than other ACC algorithms. "

Autonomous vehicle (AV) research and development has achieved a similar status in terms of money invested, societal excitement, and media coverage as space travel and exploration. At the same time, AV research is not rocket science; it is more complicated: while in itself, an AV is no more complex than a spacecraft, it must reliably interact and communicate with many other agents, particularly humans both inside and outside of the vehicle, much of it in a decentralized fashion. Hence, AVs, and their impact on us humans and our transportation systems, incur some of the most complicated science and engineering challenges that we shall face in the near future. At the same time, there is some disconnect across the various research communities: professional product development is highly opaque, and public expectations and media communications are frequently inaccurate or exaggerated. This long program aims to address these problems by connecting research communities, bridging gaps between theory and practice, exposing software experts to hardware and vice versa, and bringing mathematicians, other scientists, and engineers together to shape the research and development agenda on AVs, both in terms of individual and holistic components. Key mathematical themes in this program are:•  Robustness of machine learning•  Connecting micro and the macro scales•  Reinventing traffic flow theory in a non-local world•  Multi-agents systems, sparse controls, distributed leaders•  Fleet optimization and routing in a fully connected world•  Mathematics of societal impact of AVs "

The question of parameter identifiability of such models (i. e. , whether it is possible to infer its unknown parameters from the experimental data) is a central system analysis question, and yet still remains open. We present both structural and practical parameter identifiability analysis on four common car-following models: (i) the constant-time headway relative-velocity (CTH-RV) model, (ii) the optimal velocity model (OV), (iii) the follow-the-leader model (FTL) and (iv) the intelligent driver model (IDM). The structural identifiability analysis is carried out using a differential geometry approach, which confirms that, in theory, all of the tested car-following systems are structurally locally identifiable, i. e. , the parameters can be uniquely inferred under almost all initial condition and admissible inputs by observing the space gap alone. In a practical setting, we propose an optimization-based numerical direct test to determine parameter identifiability given a specific experimental setup (the specific initial conditions and input are known). The direct test conclusively finds distinct parameters under which the CTH-RV and FTL are not identifiable under the given initial condition and input trajectory. "
