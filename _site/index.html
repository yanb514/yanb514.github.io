    "title": "I made an app with vibe coding",
    "body": "2025/06/04 - Summer offers a rare window to explore the “fun” ideas that often get pushed aside during the academic year. With the growing popular vibe coding tools and remarkably capable AI agents, I was drawn to experiment with a project that brings together two personal interests: music and data. One of the ideas I had was to build a dashboard that analyzes my music listening profile — how open-minded is my taste, how it changes over time, and where it falls within the broader musical spectrum. Sure, Spotify Wrapped offers an already pretty comprehensive summary, but I’m really curious what goes under the hood. I started prototyping in Replit — a vibe coding tool where you can literally prompt with natural language — and it writes the code for you. I was impressed. It is fluid, responsive, and great for quickly iterating on data-driven ideas. Here’s an early version of the result:My Music Taste Profile. Tools &amp; Stack: This dashboard came together with a hybrid stack of backend logic, frontend interactivity, and good old data crunching:  Spotify Web API for real-time user listening data Node. js + Express for server and authentication (OAuth 2. 0) Vanilla JavaScript + HTML/CSS for the UI SQLite for caching and performance Python for diversity metric computation Custom-built genre hierarchy for tree-based diversity analysisFeatures Overview: At its core, the app does a few key things:  Authenticates the user via Spotify Fetches their top tracks across multiple time windows Analyzes genre diversity and artist frequencies Visualizes insights in a clean, interactive dashboardSystem architecture: 1. User Authentication  └── Spotify OAuth → Access Token2. Data Collection  └── Spotify API → Track/Artist Data → SQLite Cache3. Genre Processing  └── Python Scripts → Hierarchy Tree → Diversity Metrics4. Frontend Display  └── Cached Data → Interactive VisualizationsTop artists and top tracks: The app fetches my top tracks across three periods: Short Term (last 4 weeks), Medium Term (last 6 months) and Long Term (all time). It pulls genre tags from Spotify and supplements missing data using the Last. fm API for better coverage. Top artists and top tracks. Genre diversity analysis: One question I was particularly interested in exploring was:“How diverse is my listening taste, and how does it span across a global genre taxonomy?” To begin answering this, I constructed a hierarchical genre map based on all the genre tags found in my listening history. The structure expands dynamically as new genres are encountered,, and gives a living view of how my taste maps onto the broader musical landscape. In the example below, 42 subgenres (from my top 300 tracks) are highlighted on a genre tree of 123 total subgenres. Jazz accounted for 14. 7% of my listening, and K-pop covered 11. 3%. Genre hierarchy tree with my listening subgenres highlighted. As someone who gravitates toward metrics, I turned to concepts from phylogenetics and ecological diversity to quantify the breadth of my genre preferences:  Normalized Total Pairwise Distance (TPD) measures the average distance between all pairs of genres in the hierarchy, normalized by the max possible distance. [\textrm{Diversity}{TPD} = \dfrac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\sum{i&lt;j}\textrm{tree_distance}(g_i, g_j)]  Lowest Common Ancester (LCA) measure how deep in the tree the closest common ancestor lies for each genre pair — the deeper, the less diverse. [\textrm{Diversity}{LCA} = \dfrac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\sum{i&lt;j}\left(1-\frac{\textrm{depth}(\textrm{LCA}(g_i, g_j))}{\textrm{max_depth}}\right)] Each value is between 0-1. Low value means low diversity, that all my genres are close together with respect to the hierarchy tree; high value means high variance, that my listening genres span across distant musical categories. As you can see, my TPD=0. 855 and LCA=0. 866. Which means… I’m a wide sampler! My listening spans across multiple, distant musical traditions. This aligns with what I saw in last year’s Spotify Wrapped too — but here, I know exactly how that conclusion is derived. Challenges: Of course, there were some data cleanups I had to do. Several challenges include:  Missing genre labels: Many tracks don’t have genre data. I had to query artist metadata as a fallback.  Inconsistent genre vocabularies: Some genres are too broad (“pop”), others hyper-specific (“baroque pop”, “yacht rock”).  Ambiguity in music genere categorization: Grouping subgenres under major categories involved some subjective heuristics. Should “jazztronica” live under jazz or electronic?Despite these complications, it was a great opportunity to apply data cleaning, pattern matching, and thoughtful taxonomy design. What’s Next: Spotify’s API has recently restricted access to features like audio analysis (e. g. , danceability, loudness, mood), but there’s still much to explore with third-party APIs like Last. fm. Future features I’m excited about:  🎭 Mood &amp; emotion analysis 📈 Popularity vs. cult-following detection 🧠 Which artists have consistent longevity vs. one-hit spikes? 🗓️ Does track age correlate with user engagement?There’s a “Popular Opinions” tab in the UI already scaffolded for some of these ideas. Possible datasets include Spotify 1. 2 million songs, and Spotify tracks dataset. Final Thoughts: This project brought together two of my favorite things: experimenting with technology and exploring the intersection of data and music. I learned about full-stack development, OAuth authentication, backend data structuring, and how to turn messy, real-world data into interpretable insights. "

    "title": "A digital twin infrastructure calibrated on real-world corridor data",
    "body": "2024/07/01 - Imagine you’re driving on a congested freeway and find yourself caught in stop-and-go waves. These seemingly spontaneous traffic patterns—where vehicles repeatedly speed up and slow down—are surprisingly hard to replicate in microsimulation models. Even with perfectly calibrated inputs based on individual vehicle trajectories, many models struggle to capture the collective dynamics that emerge at the system level. The problem: For decades, we’ve been working toward building digital twins of our roadways—but a persistent gap remains between the microscopic and macroscopic. On one hand, we can model how individual drivers behave in close detail: how one car follows another, how drivers react to speed changes, and so on. But when we zoom out, those same models often fail to reproduce the larger traffic phenomena we actually observe—like stop-and-go waves or systemic congestion. So here’s the question: instead of fixating on modeling every vehicle’s trajectory (which is difficult to observe and even harder to scale), what if we focused on the emergent patterns we can see and measure? The approach: calibration based on the patterns: Rather than attempting to replicate every vehicle trajectory (an area extensively studied through driver behavior identification and car-following model calibration), we shift focus to what transportation agencies have long measured and monitored: flow, speed, and occupancy, as captured by loop detectors embedded in most highways. These aggregate traffic metrics offer a practical and scalable foundation for building behaviorally realistic digital twins of freeway systems. Our approach implements a simulation-in-the-Loop optimization framework, where the traffic simulation environment (SUMO) is iteratively tuned to align with real-world sensor data. This creates a feedback loop: observed traffic patterns guide the simulation, and the simulation continuously adjusts its internal parameters to better reflect reality. The workflow is:  Data-driven initialization: Real-time or historical measurements from loop detectors feed into the model, including flow, speed, and occupancy at measured locations.  Behavioral tuning: We adjust microscopic simulation parameters governing car-following, lane-changing, and speed choice behavior to improve fidelity.  Pattern-level validation: Custom metrics assess how well the simulated traffic reproduces observed system-level patterns (e. g. , shockwave propagation, congestion dynamics). Some findings: In the process of calibration, we found that although there are a wide range of parameters to tune (e. g. , following distance preferences, lane-changing aggresiveness, speed heterogeneity), only a few things actually impact the overall traffic patterns:  IDM parameters such as free-flow speed and desired time-headway, predominately influences the patterns Speed measurements alone are usually sufficient to calibrate all parametersScaling up: Interstate 24 as a testbed: The true test of our framework came when we applied it to a real-world freeway segment: Interstate 24. This corridor experiences the full spectrum of traffic behavior—from free-flow conditions to heavy congestion—and offered a challenging, high-variability environment for model validation. The results were promising:Our calibrated simulation reproduced key macroscopic features such as recurring bottlenecks, stop-and-go waves, and flow breakdowns. The model generalized well to different traffic conditions. All of these are achieved using DOT type of traffic measurement data only. Why this matters: With a validated digital twin that mirrors real-world traffic behavior, agencies and researchers can explore scenarios that are otherwise risky, costly, or impossible to test in the field:  Evaluating emerging technologies: Assess how connected or autonomous vehicles influence traffic stability and throughput.  Traffic operations optimization: Simulate new signal timing plans or ramp metering strategies before live deployment.  Infrastructure planning: Compare the cost-effectiveness of adding lanes versus smarter traffic management.  Policy testing: Model the impact of regulatory changes like variable speed limits, HOV lane enforcement, or tolling strategies.

Those images are converted into a digital model of how every vehicle behaves with unparalleled detail. This is all done anonymously using Artificial Intelligence (AI) trajectory algorithms developed by Vanderbilt University. Vehicle trajectory data allows us to uncover new insights into how traffic flow influences individual vehicle behavior. This groundbreaking understanding of traffic is more important than ever due to the increasing automation capability of individual vehicles, which are beginning to influence traffic flow through their interactions with conventional vehicles. By unlocking a new understanding of how these vehicles influence traffic, vehicle and infrastructure design can be optimized to reduce traffic concerns in the future to improve safety, air quality, and fuel efficiency. The purpose of I-24 MOTION is to provide an environment for testing advanced traffic management and automated vehicle technologies in real freeway traffic. Automakers and suppliers are investing billions of dollars in adding connectivity and automation features to vehicles, forever changing safety and mobility. These technologies are often developed in the laboratory or closed-course settings. Testing in traffic captures the variability of real-world conditions and human behavior. Complementary congestion management technologies are being installed by TDOT along this same section of interstate as part of the I-24 SMART Corridor project. Read more about the I-24 MOTION project from TDOT. Using the information gathered on this testbed, I-24 MOTION will provide insights to allow the industry to build better products and allow TDOT to better understand how to make the most out of these products for managing infrastructure assets.

    "title": "Real-time multi-object tracking on streaming data: a graph algorithm that actualy scales",
    "body": "2023/09/12 - Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a well-established problem in computer vision. However, the emerging challenge for modern traffic management lies in scaling these algorithms to operate in real-time. As we increasingly rely on high-resolution, multi-camera systems to monitor traffic flow and safety, the demand for fast, scalable data association grows. Stitching together fragmented vehicle trajectories across disparate video feeds—under tight latency constraints—is no longer a research luxury but a deployment necessity. In this post, I’ll walk through a graph-based online algorithm I developed with collaborators: a memory-efficient, real-time extension of the Minimum Cost Circulation (MCC) framework for MOT. This algorithm has been successfully deployed on the I-24 MOTION system, operated by the Tennessee Department of Transportation. The system captures dense vehicle trajectory data using 276 AI-enabled cameras on a stretch of Interstate 24. Our method enables near-real-time processing of video fragments, operating at speeds that match—or in some cases, exceed—the upstream data ingestion rate. It’s an example of how rigorous algorithm design translates directly into field-scale operational intelligence. Check out this video! The problem: video tracking data is fragmented in the real world: Whether you’re tracking vehicles on a freeway or individuals in a retail environment, raw detections are rarely clean and continuous. In practice, they’re often fragmented into tracklets due to occlusions, camera blind spots, and the conservative nature of upstream object detectors. In large-scale, multi-camera systems like the I-24 MOTION project, a single object can generate multiple disjointed fragments, each tied to a specific camera’s field of view. Vehicle detection. This work is led by Derek Gloudemans, and the tracking quality has improved significantly since this snapshot. The team’s computer vision papers can be found here. Even more, real-world infrastructure introduces additional noise and unreliability. Wobbly camera mounts, intermittent data loss, and even temporary camera outages result in incomplete spatial or temporal coverage. These artifacts make the task of reconstructing complete trajectories both algorithmically complex and operationally critical. This is a time-space diagram of all the trajectories. The black gaps are due to camera misalignment or being offline. Our team has documented these real-world engineering challenges extensively through system reports and peer-reviewed publications. MOT, then, is not just an early step in a vision pipeline—it’s a crucial postprocessing stage for transforming noisy detection data into coherent trajectories. Yet, most MOT algorithms rely on a batch-processing paradigm, requiring all detections to be collected before performing association. In streaming contexts, that assumption breaks down. Our algorithm addresses this head-on, offering a truly online, incremental solution for real-time data association under imperfect conditions. The backbone: min-cost circulation (MCC) on a directed graph: At its core, MOT is a combinatorial optimization problem: we want to associate fragmented detections to reconstruct full trajectories. A principled way to frame this is through a directed graph formulation. (For a rigorous treatment of graph-based MOT, see Zhang et al. ). Here’s a simplified breakdown of the formulation:  Each fragment is modeled as a pair of nodes.  Edges encode the cost of inclusion, the likelihood of transitions between fragments, and the probability of fragment start/end points.  The objective is to identify a set of non-overlapping cycles—each corresponding to a valid trajectory—that minimizes the total cost over the graph. In essence, this turns a set of detection fragments into a structured graph, where nodes and edges represent the data association problem. The optimal association solution corresponds to a flow of object paths through this graph. Turning a set of fragments into a directed graph. The edge weights are not labeled here. To solve this, we apply a powerful tool from network flow theory: the Negative Cycle Canceling (NCC) algorithm. By operating on the residual graph, NCC incrementally improves the solution by identifying and pushing “flow” through negative-cost cycles. This guarantees convergence to an optimal circulation—a globally optimal assignment of fragments to trajectories. NCC algorithm works by iteratively improving the solution (canceling negative-cost cycles) until no such cycles (optimality condition). However, there’s a catch: NCC is inherently a batch algorithm. It assumes that the full graph—with all historical data—is available upfront. This assumption breaks down under real-world scale. In systems like I-24 MOTION, we process data from 276 freeway cameras, generating 200–300K fragments per hour. A typical session spans four hours or more, resulting in a graph with millions of nodes and edges. Running batch NCC on a graph of this scale is computationally prohibitive. Even if the algorithm guarantees optimality, the latency and memory demands make it unfit for real-time applications—unless we rethink how NCC is deployed. The innovation: online NCC that’s memory-bounded: The core innovation of this work is the online extension of the Negative Cycle Canceling (NCC) algorithm. Think of it as a rolling-horizon version of NCC. Instead of constructing one massive graph with all historical data, we maintain a dynamic graph cache—a bounded subset of recent fragments within a sliding time window. As new fragments arrive, they’re added to the graph; older fragments, whose matching opportunities have expired, are systematically removed. This dynamic maintenance of the residual graph allows real-time updates without ever having to process the full trajectory space all at once. A memory-bounded online solution. This idea might sound intuitive—but making it work rigorously requires careful theoretical treatment. In fact, prior literature provided no guarantees that NCC would remain optimal or even valid when applied to a dynamic graph structure. The correctness of our online extension hinges on two important observations:	1. 	Temporal ordering of fragments: Fragments arrive (roughly) in chronological order. That is, newly added fragments typically correspond to objects that appear later in time. 	2. 	Temporal locality of matching: If a fragment isn’t matched within a short temporal window (e. g. , 5 minutes), the chance it will match with future fragments is negligible. These observations are not just heuristics—they give our graph some special structures to allow the NCC algorithm to work efficiently:  Observation 1 ensures that adding a fragment preserves the structure of the residual graph—no past decisions are invalidated.  Observation 2 justifies the safe deletion of older fragments and their edges without violating flow feasibility or missing potential matches. In more technical terms, optimality is preserved at every step. Each update maintains flow conservation, and the negative cycle condition (the optimal condition) still holds after each fragment insertion and deletion. This guarantees that each iteration improves—or at least maintains—the global objective. Every update will remain optimal. The proof is here. Elegant. The results: As you might expect, the runtime scales linearly with the input rate. In practice, this means that by enforcing an upper bound on the temporal window (e. g. , five minutes), we can cap the graph size to approximately 2,000 nodes—corresponding to around 1,000 active fragments at any given time. MOT is only a part of the data processing pipeline. Full details see this paper. Under this configuration, the system processes 6,000 fragments in about one minute. A full hour of data—roughly 200,000 fragments—takes approximately 33 minutes to process end-to-end. This effectively makes the algorithm “online” in practical terms, as the processing time consistently stays below the real-time data accumulation rate. Of course, MOT is just one stage of a much larger system. In production, we integrated additional components including parallelized I/O for reading and writing to databases, as well as a post-processing step for smoothing trajectories. The system was built in Python using asynchronous scheduling to orchestrate real-time processing across multiple stages efficiently. Final thoughts: the art of real-time design: In the age of data streams, reliability meets responsiveness at the algorithmic level. When moving an established algorithm to the online version, certain theoretical properties may not hold. Nevertheless, they can still benefit practical deployment. In our case, the deletion part of the graph was technically not proved to be truth, but in practice it’s observed to be not impacting the performance. In the end, it’s a balance of theoretical precision and real-world constraints. If you’re building systems where object association matters—whether it’s traffic, inventory, or people—this kind of real-time thinking pays dividends.

If you have ever encountered a temporary traffic jam for no apparent reason, this might have been a phantom jam that occurred naturally because of human driving behavior. Prior work on closed-course testing demonstrated that phantom jams can be reduced using autonomous vehicle technologies and specially-designed algorithms. The CIRCLES project seeks to extend this technology to real-world traffic, where reducing these negative traffic effects could provide ≥10% energy savings.

    "body": "2022/08/05 - Vehicle trajectory data has received increasing research attention over the past decades. With the technological sensing improvements such as high-resolution video cameras, in-vehicle radars and lidars, abundant individual and contextual traffic data is now available. However, though the data quantity is massive, it is by itself of limited utility for traffic research because of noise and systematic sensing errors, thus necessitates proper processing to ensure data quality.  YouTube: I-24 MOTION data postprocessing algorithms We draw particular attention to extracting high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from video cameras as traffic monitoring cameras are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. We explore methods for automatic trajectory data reconciliation, given “raw” vehicle detection and tracking information from automatic video processing algorithms. We propose a pipeline including a) an online data association algorithm to match fragments that are associated to the same object (vehicle), which is formulated as a min-cost network flow problem of a graph, and b) a trajectory reconciliation method formulated as a quadratic program to enhance raw detection data. The pipeline leverages vehicle dynamics and physical constraints to associate tracked objects when they become fragmented, remove measurement noise on trajectories and impute missing data due to fragmentations. The accuracy is benchmarked on a sample of manually-labeled data, which shows that the reconciled trajectories improve the accuracy on all the tested input data for a wide range of measures. An online version of the reconciliation pipeline is implemented and will be applied in a continuous video processing system running on a camera network covering a 4-mile stretch of Interstate-24 near Nashville, Tennessee.

    "body": "2021/11/18 - This work explores the state estimation problem for heterogeneous traffic (a multiclass flow composed of vehicles with distinct sizes and driving behaviours) usingparticle filtering (PF) approaches. We consider three enhanced variations of thebootstrap PF to improve estimation. The benchmark PF utilises a deterministicpartial differential equation and an additive process noise that is state-independent. For the enhanced variations we first consider a parameter-adaptive PF that alsoallows model parameters to be adjusted. The second variation is a standard PFwith spatially-correlated noise. The last variation combines parameter-adaptive andthe spatially-correlated-noise approaches. We compare the four filters in numericalexperiments that represent complex heterogeneous traffic scenarios, as well as onreal-world heterogeneous traffic data. The results show that the enhanced filters canachieve up to an 80% and 46% of accuracy improvement as compared to an openloop simulation without measurement correction, with the synthetic settings andwith real traffic data, respectively. Moreover, the enhanced filters outperform thestandard PF in all the traffic scenarios based on accuracy. Resources:  Estimation for heterogeneous traffic using enhanced particle filters"

    "body": "2021/05/11 - Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) have matured over the past few decades with the dedication to enhance user experience and gain a wider market penetration. However, personalization components, as a mean to make the current technologies more acceptable and trustworthy for users, have been gaining momentum only very recently. In my recent work with Toyota InfoTech Labs, we aim to learn personalized longitudinal driving behaviors via a Gaussian Process (GP) model. The proposed method learns from individual driver’s naturalistic car-following behavior, and outputs a desired acceleration profile that suits the user’s preference. The learned model, together with a predictive safety filter that prevents rear-end collision, is used as a personalized adaptive cruise control (PACC) system. Numerical experiments show that GP-based PACC (GP-PACC) can reproduce the driving styles of human drivers up to 80% more accurately than baseline models (i. e. , optimal velocity model and intelligent driver model). Additionally, GP-PACC is further validated by human-in-the-loop experiments on the Unity game engine-based driving simulator. Trips driven by GP-PACC and two other baseline ACC algorithms with driver override rates are recorded and compared. Results show that all drivers override the GP-PACC less frequently, indicating drivers trust GP-PACC more than other ACC algorithms. "

Autonomous vehicle (AV) research and development has achieved a similar status in terms of money invested, societal excitement, and media coverage as space travel and exploration. At the same time, AV research is not rocket science; it is more complicated: while in itself, an AV is no more complex than a spacecraft, it must reliably interact and communicate with many other agents, particularly humans both inside and outside of the vehicle, much of it in a decentralized fashion. Hence, AVs, and their impact on us humans and our transportation systems, incur some of the most complicated science and engineering challenges that we shall face in the near future. At the same time, there is some disconnect across the various research communities: professional product development is highly opaque, and public expectations and media communications are frequently inaccurate or exaggerated. This long program aims to address these problems by connecting research communities, bridging gaps between theory and practice, exposing software experts to hardware and vice versa, and bringing mathematicians, other scientists, and engineers together to shape the research and development agenda on AVs, both in terms of individual and holistic components. Key mathematical themes in this program are:•  Robustness of machine learning•  Connecting micro and the macro scales•  Reinventing traffic flow theory in a non-local world•  Multi-agents systems, sparse controls, distributed leaders•  Fleet optimization and routing in a fully connected world•  Mathematics of societal impact of AVs "

The question of parameter identifiability of such models (i. e. , whether it is possible to infer its unknown parameters from the experimental data) is a central system analysis question, and yet still remains open. We present both structural and practical parameter identifiability analysis on four common car-following models: (i) the constant-time headway relative-velocity (CTH-RV) model, (ii) the optimal velocity model (OV), (iii) the follow-the-leader model (FTL) and (iv) the intelligent driver model (IDM). The structural identifiability analysis is carried out using a differential geometry approach, which confirms that, in theory, all of the tested car-following systems are structurally locally identifiable, i. e. , the parameters can be uniquely inferred under almost all initial condition and admissible inputs by observing the space gap alone. In a practical setting, we propose an optimization-based numerical direct test to determine parameter identifiability given a specific experimental setup (the specific initial conditions and input are known). The direct test conclusively finds distinct parameters under which the CTH-RV and FTL are not identifiable under the given initial condition and input trajectory. "

Using low cost urban sensing networks, it is possible to measure the impacts of mitigation strategies in communities at a fine-grained scale, informing context-aware policies and infrastructure design. However, fine-grained city-scale data analysis is complicated by common, tedious data cleaning tasks such as removing outliers and imputing missing data. To address the challenge of data cleaning, this article introduces a robust low-rank tensor factorization method to automatically correct anomalies and impute missing entries for high-dimensional urban environmental datasets. We validate the method on a synthetically degraded National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration temperature dataset, with a recovery error of 4%, and apply it to the Array of Things city-scale sensor network in Chicago, IL.

The methods are also assessed on empirical data collected from a 2019 model year ACC vehicle driven in a highway environment. Speed, space gap, and relative velocity data are recorded directly from the factory-installed radar unit via the vehicle’s CAN bus. The least-squares method has the fastest run-time performance, and is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than other methods. The particle filter is faster than real-time, and therefore is suitable in streaming applications in which the datasets can grow arbitrarily large. "
