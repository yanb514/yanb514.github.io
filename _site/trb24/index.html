    "body": "I occasionally provide pro bono, small-scope, and fast-turnaround consulting for external partners interested in making better use of complex, real-world data—particularly in transportation and adjacent domains. These engagements are intended to foster collaboration, explore practical challenges in data science, and broaden the real-world impact of my technical expertise. Typical engagements may include:  A no-cost, 30-minute discovery call to understand your data or analytics challenge A lightweight data audit – You provide sample data or API access, and I return insights, visualizations, and recommendations (typically within 2 weeks, or 16 hours) Proof-of-concept prototype - a minimal, illustrative demo to visualize early-stage ideas or strategies Optional follow-up discussions – to help teams frame next steps, refine use cases, or plan roadmap developmentWho might benefit This service is a good fit for public- and private-sector teams seeking technically informed, low-overhead feedback—without committing to long-term consulting engagements. Example clients include:  Public agencies exploring how to leverage mobility or infrastructure data Transportation/logistics firms rethinking operational questions Insurance companies exploring risk, behavior, or vehicle telematics data Startups validating a data-driven MVP or looking to prototype live dashboards Innovation and R&amp;D teams working on IoT, sensing, or edge/real-time analyticsI am especially interested in early-stage or exploratory projects where strategic thinking and minimal modeling can make a big difference quickly. Important notes &amp; disclaimers This consulting work is conducted independently of my academic role at Arizona State University. This work is not affiliated with or endorsed by ASU, and no university resources, branding, or student labor are involved. In accordance with ASU policy, all consulting activities are disclosed through the university’s Conflict of Interest (COI) reporting process. Time spent on these efforts complies with university limits on outside activities (typically capped at 1 day per week during the academic year). Interested in connecting? If you’d like to explore a small-scope collaboration, please reach out at the following address with a brief message that includes:  A brief description of your data or analytics challenge The type of input or deliverables you’re hoping for Your ideal timelineI’ll do my best to respond promptly, though response times may vary depending on teaching and research commitments. Please note that I reserve the right to accept or decline requests based on fit, scope, and availability. "

    "title": "Predicting traffic delay impact from roadwork: a data-driven approach to work zone management",
    "body": "2025/11/22 - Phoenix’s Interstate 10 Broadway Curve represents one of Arizona’s busiest freeway corridors. Its 11-mile segment between Loop 202 and I-17 recently underwent a four-year reconstruction project involving major lane closures. While necessary for infrastructure improvement, such construction activities create significant traffic disruptions that ripple through the entire Phoenix metropolitan area. WorkZoneWatch aims to quantify and predict the short-term delay impacts of planned roadwork and unplanned incidents along this corridor to support ADOT’s construction scheduling and traffic management decisions. Using INRIX historical speed data and AZ511 work zone and incident reports, I developed predictive models to estimate segment-level travel times and conducted counterfactual analysis to isolate the delay attributable to construction events. This post presents the methodology, findings, and their implications for data-driven traffic operations. Area: I-10 Broadway Curve: 11-mile stretch between Loop 202 and I-17 (source: ADOT) Background and Motivation: Traffic congestion imposes significant economic costs nationally, with the average urban driver losing 51 hours annually to congestion at an estimated cost of $869 per person. Phoenix experiences above-average impacts, with commuters losing 69 hours annually. Arizona’s 122,000 crashes in 2023, including 37,000 with injuries, further underscore the critical need for effective traffic management solutions. ADOT’s Traffic Operations Center (TOC) operates 24/7 as a statewide traffic management hub, monitoring traffic conditions and coordinating incident response. Arizona’s traveler information system, AZ511, provides real-time updates on travel times, crashes, and camera feeds. However, these tools primarily report current conditions and lack predictive capabilities, limiting their effectiveness for proactive traffic management. Current practice relies on static tools such as the Work Zone Queue and Delay Analysis Spreadsheet or general heuristics to assess the impact of lane closures and incidents. While helpful for planning, these methods are not suited for dynamic, real-time conditions. Without forecasting capabilities, agencies cannot reliably predict short-term congestion or proactively inform travelers, leaving platforms like AZ511 and dynamic message signs fundamentally reactive. Dataset Generation and Integration: I started by integrating two primary data sources to build a predictive delay model: traffic speed observations and event records. The dataset combines AZ511 event reports with INRIX historical traffic speed data through spatial and temporal matching to produce a unified, segment-level time series. AZ511 Event Data: The AZ511 Traveler Information Platform provides event-based data on scheduled work zones and unplanned incidents across Arizona through the WZDx API. I developed an automated data pipeline that collects event records every three hours and stores them in a local SQLite database. From June through October 2025, 48,109 event records were collected, with 474 events mapped to the I-10 Broadway Curve corridor. Each record includes location, direction, timing, and event classification following the WZDx specification. To integrate this information with traffic data, we performed geolocation by mapping events using their latitude-longitude coordinates to the nearest INRIX Traffic Message Channel (TMC) segments in both travel directions. However, exploratory analysis revealed several data quality issues. Event updates appear to occur in batch intervals of approximately 3 hours, and unplanned events are significantly underreported. Several crashes reported in local news were missing from AZ511 data. Event descriptions are inconsistently defined, with vague or nonstandard entries (e. g. , “C34Rshoulder” and “Crash on right shoulder” representing identical conditions). The Severity field is missing in roughly 90% of records, limiting its utility for feature engineering. To ensure analytical consistency, I manually reclassified events into two categories—planned (work zones, closures) and unplanned (crashes, incidents)—based on their subtype descriptions. Spatial matching of AZ511 events to TMC segments along the I-10 Broadway Curve. Each color represents a unique TMC segment. INRIX Historical Traffic Speed Data: INRIX provides minute-level observations of vehicle speed, free-flow speed, and travel time for individual TMC segments derived from floating-car data. The dataset spans September 2024 through October 2025 and covers 50 TMC segments along I-10. Missing observations were interpolated using temporal smoothing, and duplicate segments were removed. The time range was aligned with AZ511 event records (June–October 2025). Both event and speed data were synchronized and aggregated into uniform one-hour intervals. The final dataset forms a 3D tensor with dimensions (50 TMC segments × 2,374 time bins × 20 features). Augmented features include road geometry (segment length, ramps, curvature), cyclic time variables (hour of day and day of week encoded as sine/cosine), lagged travel time, and synchronized planned and unplanned events with their subtypes and durations. Travel time heatmap by segments on Westbound I-10 Broadway Curve from June-October 2025. The dataset exhibits significant class imbalance, with only 0. 87% of {TMC, time_bin} entries containing event information. This imbalance required special handling during model training to prevent models from learning to simply predict “no event” conditions. Modeling Approach: Two classes of models were trained based on their treatment of spatial and temporal dependencies. The objective was to predict segment-level travel times under both recurring and non-recurring congestion conditions. Tabular Regression Models: Tabular regression models—including Linear Regression (OLS, Ridge, Lasso) and Tree-Based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Regression Trees, XGBoost)—were trained on independent {TMC, time_bin} entries without explicit spatial or temporal structure. These models treat each observation as independent and rely on feature engineering to capture time-of-day patterns and spatial characteristics. Due to the severe class imbalance (events occur in less than 1% of time bins), non-event entries were downsampled to achieve approximately 50% event balance in the training data. This prevents models from trivially learning to predict normal traffic conditions while ignoring event impacts. Sequence Models: Sequence models were designed to capture temporal continuity and spatial correlations. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were trained as global models on TMC time-series sliced into 24-hour sequences, enabling the model to learn temporal dependencies across the corridor. Graph Convolutional Network LSTM (GCN-LSTM) extends this approach by incorporating spatial structure, using graph convolutions to model how congestion propagates between connected TMC segments. Feature Engineering: For each model family, various feature combinations were tested:  Road features only Road + events (evt) Road + events + lagged travel time (lag) Road + lag Road + cyclic time features (cyc) Road + cyclic + lag Full features: road + cyclic + events + lagLagged travel time features (1, 2, and 3 hours prior) proved to be the most predictive, capturing short-term persistence in traffic conditions. Cyclic time features encoded daily and weekly periodicity using sine and cosine transformations of hour-of-day and day-of-week. Feature importance identified by XGBoost. Model Performance and Evaluation: Cross-validation results showed that adding lagged travel time features substantially improved prediction accuracy across all model families. Among tabular models, XGBoost achieved the lowest test RMSE when trained with full features. However, LSTM demonstrated the best overall prediction accuracy, followed by XGBoost. Feature importance identified by XGBoost. Feature importance identified by XGBoost. The following heatmaps visualize predicted travel times for westbound I-10 using XGBoost and LSTM with full feature sets. Both models successfully capture the diurnal patterns and spatial variation in travel times along the corridor. XGBoost model with full features. LSTM model with full features. Feature importance analysis using XGBoost revealed that lagged travel time features dominated model performance, contributing significantly more than event-related features. This finding suggests two insights: first, traffic conditions exhibit strong temporal autocorrelation over 1-3 hour windows; second, event reporting may not be sufficiently synchronized with resulting traffic patterns to serve as a strong predictive signal. All models were designed for one-step-ahead prediction: given current or recent states, predict travel time in the next time bin. They are not configured for multi-step or recursive forecasting, which would require different architectural considerations to prevent error accumulation. Counterfactual Analysis: Estimating Event-Induced Delay: Predicting travel times is operationally useful, but transportation agencies require causal estimates: how much delay is attributable to specific events? In the absence of randomized controlled trials or natural experiments, we employed counterfactual analysis using machine learning to estimate event-induced delays. Methodology: The counterfactual approach estimates what traffic conditions would have been in the absence of an event by training a separate model on “clean” data. Specifically:  Data preparation: Remove all observations within ±3 hours of any reported event Feature exclusion: Remove event-related features and lag features potentially influenced by events Model training: Train XGBoost on the filtered dataset to learn baseline (no-event) traffic patterns Delay estimation: Compute the difference between full model predictions (with events) and counterfactual model predictions (without events)This approach assumes that the counterfactual model captures normal recurring congestion patterns (time-of-day, day-of-week effects), while the full model incorporates both recurring patterns and event-induced disruptions. The difference isolates the marginal impact of events. Because this process disrupts temporal continuity by removing event-influenced periods, sequence models (LSTM, GCN-LSTM) could not be used for counterfactual analysis, as they require complete time-series data for training. XGBoost’s tabular structure made it suitable for this analysis. Findings: Counterfactual analysis revealed that planned work zones induce measurable, lagged delays that persist several hours beyond event start times:  Magnitude: Planned events cause approximately 15 seconds per mile of additional delay (roughly 3 minutes across the 11-mile Broadway Curve segment), approximately doubling routine congestion levels Temporal patterns: Delays peak 3-5 hours after work zone activation, not immediately upon closure Diurnal variation: Event-induced delays are most disruptive during weekday early afternoons (12-3 PM) and weekend mornings These findings indicate that traffic recovery following lane closures is neither immediate nor symmetric. The lagged delay patterns suggest that congestion propagates upstream and requires several hours to dissipate, even after the physical obstruction is removed. While ADOT’s current mitigation strategies—including off-peak and weekend closures—reduce delays relative to peak-hour work, they do not eliminate disruption. Weekend closures still generate measurable delays during morning hours when recreational and commercial traffic volumes are substantial. Economic Impact Assessment: The economic cost of construction-induced delays was estimated using standard congestion cost methodologies. Calculations are based on:  Average congestion cost: $17. 90 per hour per commuter (INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard 2024) Average daily traffic volume: 300,000 vehicles on I-10 during weekdays (abs15 News) Annual vehicle miles traveled (VMT): 19. 4 million per day on the I-10 corridor (State of Arizona Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan)Results indicate:  878 hours of daily delay during the Broadway Curve Improvement project period $5. 7 million annually for the 11-mile Broadway Curve segment alone 1. 8 million annual hours corridor-wide ($33 million per year)These estimates suggest that optimizing construction schedules based on predictive delay models could reduce congestion time by approximately 50%, potentially saving Phoenix-area commuters up to $33 million annually. The analysis underscores the economic value of data-driven work zone scheduling and highlights the importance of improved event reporting systems for accurate prediction. Key Insights and Limitations: Methodological Contributions:  Data integration framework: Combining AZ511 event data with INRIX traffic speeds through spatiotemporal matching creates a dataset substantially more valuable than either source alone for causal analysis Temporal feature engineering: Lagged travel time features (1-3 hours) capture short-term traffic persistence and substantially improve prediction accuracy across all model architectures Counterfactual analysis for causal inference: Machine learning-based counterfactual modeling enables estimation of event-induced delays in the absence of experimental controls, providing a practical approach to causal inference in operational settingsData Quality Limitations:  Event reporting latency and completeness: AZ511 updates occur in approximately 3-hour batches (also varying by jurisdictions), introducing lag between incident occurrence and system reporting. Many incidents documented in local news sources were absent from AZ511 records Metadata inconsistency: Severity fields are missing in 90% of event records. Event subtype descriptions use inconsistent and sometimes undefined codes, requiring manual reclassification Sequence model constraints: LSTM and GCN-LSTM models require continuous time-series data and cannot accommodate the temporal gaps created by removing event-influenced periods for counterfactual analysisThese limitations suggest that improved real-time event detection—potentially through anomaly detection in traffic speed patterns—may be more reliable than depending solely on official incident reporting systems. Future Steps: Several extensions could improve the predictive accuracy and operational utility of this work: Real-Time Incident Detection from Traffic Patterns: Rather than relying solely on official crash reports, anomaly detection algorithms could infer incident occurrence from real-time traffic speed patterns. When a normally free-flowing segment exhibits sudden speed reductions while neighboring segments maintain normal flow, this signature strongly indicates an incident—often before official reports are filed. This approach could address the systematic underreporting observed in AZ511 data. Enhanced Feature Context:  Weather integration: Incorporating precipitation, temperature, and dust storm warnings could improve prediction accuracy during adverse conditions Event descriptions as text features: Natural language processing of event description fields could extract structured information from unstructured narratives Connected vehicle data: Real-time probe vehicle data could provide higher-resolution traffic state information than aggregated speed feedsCausal Inference Methods: Exploring formal causal inference frameworks—such as difference-in-differences, synthetic control methods, or causal forests—could provide more rigorous estimates of delay attribution when multiple factors interact (e. g. , simultaneous work zones, demand fluctuations, and weather events). System Expansion: Extending the analysis to additional corridors (Loop 101, I-17, rural highways) would test model generalizability and provide system-wide delay estimates for ADOT’s network-level traffic management. Conclusions: This work demonstrates that data-driven traffic delay prediction is operationally feasible using existing data infrastructure. Combining event records with high-resolution traffic speed data enables both short-term travel time forecasting and causal estimation of event-induced delays through counterfactual modeling. Key findings include:  Predictive accuracy: LSTM models achieve the highest prediction accuracy, with XGBoost providing comparable performance in tabular settings Delay quantification: Planned work zones cause approximately 15 seconds per mile of additional delay, with peak impacts occurring 3-5 hours after event initiation Economic significance: Optimized construction scheduling based on predictive models could reduce corridor-wide congestion costs by up to $33 million annually in the Phoenix metropolitan areaImplications for Transportation Operations: For transportation agencies, the implementation path requires:  Enhanced event reporting systems: Real-time, complete, and standardized incident feeds with consistent metadata are foundational for accurate prediction Predictive analytics integration: Machine learning models can forecast delays hours in advance, enabling proactive traffic management strategies Data-driven scheduling: Quantitative delay estimates can inform construction timing decisions to minimize economic and operational impactsThe economic case for predictive traffic management is substantial. The technical infrastructure exists, validated models are available, and the potential cost savings justify investment in operational deployment. Future work should focus on real-time system integration, expanded corridor coverage, and formal causal inference frameworks for multi-factor delay attribution.

    "body": "2025/06/04 - Summer offers a rare window to explore the “fun” ideas that often get pushed aside during the academic year. With the growing popular vibe coding tools and remarkably capable AI agents, I was drawn to experiment with a project that brings together two personal interests: music and data. One of the ideas I had was to build a dashboard that analyzes my music listening profile — how open-minded is my taste, how it changes over time, and where it falls within the broader musical spectrum. Sure, Spotify Wrapped offers an already pretty comprehensive summary, but I’m really curious what goes under the hood. I started prototyping in Replit — a vibe coding tool where you can literally prompt with natural language — and it writes the code for you. I was impressed. It is fluid, responsive, and great for quickly iterating on data-driven ideas. Here’s an early version of the result:My Music Taste Profile. Tools &amp; Stack: This dashboard came together with a hybrid stack of backend logic, frontend interactivity, and good old data crunching:  Spotify Web API for real-time user listening data Node. js + Express for server and authentication (OAuth 2. 0) Vanilla JavaScript + HTML/CSS for the UI SQLite for caching and performance Python for diversity metric computation Custom-built genre hierarchy for tree-based diversity analysisFeatures Overview: At its core, the app does a few key things:  Authenticates the user via Spotify Fetches their top tracks across multiple time windows Analyzes genre diversity and artist frequencies Visualizes insights in a clean, interactive dashboardSystem architecture: 1. User Authentication  └── Spotify OAuth → Access Token2. Data Collection  └── Spotify API → Track/Artist Data → SQLite Cache3. Genre Processing  └── Python Scripts → Hierarchy Tree → Diversity Metrics4. Frontend Display  └── Cached Data → Interactive VisualizationsTop artists and top tracks: The app fetches my top tracks across three periods: Short Term (last 4 weeks), Medium Term (last 6 months) and Long Term (all time). It pulls genre tags from Spotify and supplements missing data using the Last. fm API for better coverage. Top artists and top tracks. Genre diversity analysis: One question I was particularly interested in exploring was:“How diverse is my listening taste, and how does it span across a global genre taxonomy?” To begin answering this, I constructed a hierarchical genre map based on all the genre tags found in my listening history. The structure expands dynamically as new genres are encountered,, and gives a living view of how my taste maps onto the broader musical landscape. In the example below, 42 subgenres (from my top 300 tracks) are highlighted on a genre tree of 123 total subgenres. Jazz accounted for 14. 7% of my listening, and K-pop covered 11. 3%. Genre hierarchy tree with my listening subgenres highlighted. As someone who gravitates toward metrics, I turned to concepts from phylogenetics and ecological diversity to quantify the breadth of my genre preferences:  Normalized Total Pairwise Distance (TPD) measures the average distance between all pairs of genres in the hierarchy, normalized by the max possible distance. \[\textrm{Diversity}_{TPD} = \dfrac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\sum_{i&lt;j}\textrm{tree_distance}(g_i, g_j)\] Lowest Common Ancester (LCA) measure how deep in the tree the closest common ancestor lies for each genre pair — the deeper, the less diverse. \[\textrm{Diversity}_{LCA} = \dfrac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\sum_{i&lt;j}\left(1-\frac{\textrm{depth}(\textrm{LCA}(g_i, g_j))}{\textrm{max_depth}}\right)\]Each value is between 0-1. Low value means low diversity, that all my genres are close together with respect to the hierarchy tree; high value means high variance, that my listening genres span across distant musical categories. As you can see, my TPD=0. 855 and LCA=0. 866. Which means… I’m a wide sampler! My listening spans across multiple, distant musical traditions. This aligns with what I saw in last year’s Spotify Wrapped too — but here, I know exactly how that conclusion is derived. Challenges: Of course, there were some data cleanups I had to do. Several challenges include:  Missing genre labels: Many tracks don’t have genre data. I had to query artist metadata as a fallback.  Inconsistent genre vocabularies: Some genres are too broad (“pop”), others hyper-specific (“baroque pop”, “yacht rock”).  Ambiguity in music genere categorization: Grouping subgenres under major categories involved some subjective heuristics. Should “jazztronica” live under jazz or electronic?Despite these complications, it was a great opportunity to apply data cleaning, pattern matching, and thoughtful taxonomy design. What’s Next: Spotify’s API has recently restricted access to features like audio analysis (e. g. , danceability, loudness, mood), but there’s still much to explore with third-party APIs like Last. fm. Future features I’m excited about:  🎭 Mood &amp; emotion analysis 📈 Popularity vs. cult-following detection 🧠 Which artists have consistent longevity vs. one-hit spikes? 🗓️ Does track age correlate with user engagement?There’s a “Popular Opinions” tab in the UI already scaffolded for some of these ideas. Possible datasets include Spotify 1. 2 million songs, and Spotify tracks dataset. Final Thoughts: This project brought together two of my favorite things: experimenting with technology and exploring the intersection of data and music. I learned about full-stack development, OAuth authentication, backend data structuring, and how to turn messy, real-world data into interpretable insights. "

    "title": "A digital twin infrastructure calibrated on real-world corridor data",
    "body": "2024/07/01 - Imagine you’re driving on a congested freeway and find yourself caught in stop-and-go waves. These seemingly spontaneous traffic patterns—where vehicles repeatedly speed up and slow down—are surprisingly hard to replicate in microsimulation models. Even with perfectly calibrated inputs based on individual vehicle trajectories, many models struggle to capture the collective dynamics that emerge at the system level. The problem: For decades, we’ve been working toward building digital twins of our roadways—but a persistent gap remains between the microscopic and macroscopic. On one hand, we can model how individual drivers behave in close detail: how one car follows another, how drivers react to speed changes, and so on. But when we zoom out, those same models often fail to reproduce the larger traffic phenomena we actually observe—like stop-and-go waves or systemic congestion. So here’s the question: instead of fixating on modeling every vehicle’s trajectory (which is difficult to observe and even harder to scale), what if we focused on the emergent patterns we can see and measure? The approach: calibration based on the patterns: Rather than attempting to replicate every vehicle trajectory (an area extensively studied through driver behavior identification and car-following model calibration), we shift focus to what transportation agencies have long measured and monitored: flow, speed, and occupancy, as captured by loop detectors embedded in most highways. These aggregate traffic metrics offer a practical and scalable foundation for building behaviorally realistic digital twins of freeway systems. Our approach implements a simulation-in-the-Loop optimization framework, where the traffic simulation environment (SUMO) is iteratively tuned to align with real-world sensor data. This creates a feedback loop: observed traffic patterns guide the simulation, and the simulation continuously adjusts its internal parameters to better reflect reality. The workflow is:  Data-driven initialization: Real-time or historical measurements from loop detectors feed into the model, including flow, speed, and occupancy at measured locations.  Behavioral tuning: We adjust microscopic simulation parameters governing car-following, lane-changing, and speed choice behavior to improve fidelity.  Pattern-level validation: Custom metrics assess how well the simulated traffic reproduces observed system-level patterns (e. g. , shockwave propagation, congestion dynamics). Some findings: In the process of calibration, we found that although there are a wide range of parameters to tune (e. g. , following distance preferences, lane-changing aggresiveness, speed heterogeneity), only a few things actually impact the overall traffic patterns:  IDM parameters such as free-flow speed and desired time-headway, predominately influences the patterns Speed measurements alone are usually sufficient to calibrate all parametersScaling up: Interstate 24 as a testbed: The true test of our framework came when we applied it to a real-world freeway segment: Interstate 24. This corridor experiences the full spectrum of traffic behavior—from free-flow conditions to heavy congestion—and offered a challenging, high-variability environment for model validation. The results were promising:Our calibrated simulation reproduced key macroscopic features such as recurring bottlenecks, stop-and-go waves, and flow breakdowns. The model generalized well to different traffic conditions. All of these are achieved using DOT type of traffic measurement data only. Why this matters: With a validated digital twin that mirrors real-world traffic behavior, agencies and researchers can explore scenarios that are otherwise risky, costly, or impossible to test in the field:  Evaluating emerging technologies: Assess how connected or autonomous vehicles influence traffic stability and throughput.  Traffic operations optimization: Simulate new signal timing plans or ramp metering strategies before live deployment.  Infrastructure planning: Compare the cost-effectiveness of adding lanes versus smarter traffic management.  Policy testing: Model the impact of regulatory changes like variable speed limits, HOV lane enforcement, or tolling strategies.

Those images are converted into a digital model of how every vehicle behaves with unparalleled detail. This is all done anonymously using Artificial Intelligence (AI) trajectory algorithms developed by Vanderbilt University. Vehicle trajectory data allows us to uncover new insights into how traffic flow influences individual vehicle behavior. This groundbreaking understanding of traffic is more important than ever due to the increasing automation capability of individual vehicles, which are beginning to influence traffic flow through their interactions with conventional vehicles. By unlocking a new understanding of how these vehicles influence traffic, vehicle and infrastructure design can be optimized to reduce traffic concerns in the future to improve safety, air quality, and fuel efficiency. The purpose of I-24 MOTION is to provide an environment for testing advanced traffic management and automated vehicle technologies in real freeway traffic. Automakers and suppliers are investing billions of dollars in adding connectivity and automation features to vehicles, forever changing safety and mobility. These technologies are often developed in the laboratory or closed-course settings. Testing in traffic captures the variability of real-world conditions and human behavior. Complementary congestion management technologies are being installed by TDOT along this same section of interstate as part of the I-24 SMART Corridor project. Read more about the I-24 MOTION project from TDOT. Using the information gathered on this testbed, I-24 MOTION will provide insights to allow the industry to build better products and allow TDOT to better understand how to make the most out of these products for managing infrastructure assets. The first testbed user is the U. S. Department of Energy’s sponsored research with the CIRCLES Consortium, which is studying the possibility of smoothing traffic by introducing vehicles equipped with advanced driver-assist systems.

    "title": "Real-time multi-object tracking on streaming data: a graph algorithm that actualy scales",
    "body": "2023/09/12 - Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a well-established problem in computer vision. However, the emerging challenge for modern traffic management lies in scaling these algorithms to operate in real-time. As we increasingly rely on high-resolution, multi-camera systems to monitor traffic flow and safety, the demand for fast, scalable data association grows. Stitching together fragmented vehicle trajectories across disparate video feeds—under tight latency constraints—is no longer a research luxury but a deployment necessity. In this post, I’ll walk through a graph-based online algorithm I developed with collaborators: a memory-efficient, real-time extension of the Minimum Cost Circulation (MCC) framework for MOT. This algorithm has been successfully deployed on the I-24 MOTION system, operated by the Tennessee Department of Transportation. The system captures dense vehicle trajectory data using 276 AI-enabled cameras on a stretch of Interstate 24. Our method enables near-real-time processing of video fragments, operating at speeds that match—or in some cases, exceed—the upstream data ingestion rate. It’s an example of how rigorous algorithm design translates directly into field-scale operational intelligence. Check out this video! The problem: video tracking data is fragmented in the real world: Whether you’re tracking vehicles on a freeway or individuals in a retail environment, raw detections are rarely clean and continuous. In practice, they’re often fragmented into tracklets due to occlusions, camera blind spots, and the conservative nature of upstream object detectors. In large-scale, multi-camera systems like the I-24 MOTION project, a single object can generate multiple disjointed fragments, each tied to a specific camera’s field of view. Vehicle detection. This work is led by Derek Gloudemans, and the tracking quality has improved significantly since this snapshot. The team’s computer vision papers can be found here. Even more, real-world infrastructure introduces additional noise and unreliability. Wobbly camera mounts, intermittent data loss, and even temporary camera outages result in incomplete spatial or temporal coverage. These artifacts make the task of reconstructing complete trajectories both algorithmically complex and operationally critical. This is a time-space diagram of all the trajectories. The black gaps are due to camera misalignment or being offline. Our team has documented these real-world engineering challenges extensively through system reports and peer-reviewed publications. MOT, then, is not just an early step in a vision pipeline—it’s a crucial postprocessing stage for transforming noisy detection data into coherent trajectories. Yet, most MOT algorithms rely on a batch-processing paradigm, requiring all detections to be collected before performing association. In streaming contexts, that assumption breaks down. Our algorithm addresses this head-on, offering a truly online, incremental solution for real-time data association under imperfect conditions. The backbone: min-cost circulation (MCC) on a directed graph: At its core, MOT is a combinatorial optimization problem: we want to associate fragmented detections to reconstruct full trajectories. A principled way to frame this is through a directed graph formulation. (For a rigorous treatment of graph-based MOT, see Zhang et al. ). Here’s a simplified breakdown of the formulation:  Each fragment is modeled as a pair of nodes.  Edges encode the cost of inclusion, the likelihood of transitions between fragments, and the probability of fragment start/end points.  The objective is to identify a set of non-overlapping cycles—each corresponding to a valid trajectory—that minimizes the total cost over the graph. In essence, this turns a set of detection fragments into a structured graph, where nodes and edges represent the data association problem. The optimal association solution corresponds to a flow of object paths through this graph. Turning a set of fragments into a directed graph. The edge weights are not labeled here. To solve this, we apply a powerful tool from network flow theory: the Negative Cycle Canceling (NCC) algorithm. By operating on the residual graph, NCC incrementally improves the solution by identifying and pushing “flow” through negative-cost cycles. This guarantees convergence to an optimal circulation—a globally optimal assignment of fragments to trajectories. NCC algorithm works by iteratively improving the solution (canceling negative-cost cycles) until no such cycles (optimality condition). However, there’s a catch: NCC is inherently a batch algorithm. It assumes that the full graph—with all historical data—is available upfront. This assumption breaks down under real-world scale. In systems like I-24 MOTION, we process data from 276 freeway cameras, generating 200–300K fragments per hour. A typical session spans four hours or more, resulting in a graph with millions of nodes and edges. Running batch NCC on a graph of this scale is computationally prohibitive. Even if the algorithm guarantees optimality, the latency and memory demands make it unfit for real-time applications—unless we rethink how NCC is deployed. The innovation: online NCC that’s memory-bounded: The core innovation of this work is the online extension of the Negative Cycle Canceling (NCC) algorithm. Think of it as a rolling-horizon version of NCC. Instead of constructing one massive graph with all historical data, we maintain a dynamic graph cache—a bounded subset of recent fragments within a sliding time window. As new fragments arrive, they’re added to the graph; older fragments, whose matching opportunities have expired, are systematically removed. This dynamic maintenance of the residual graph allows real-time updates without ever having to process the full trajectory space all at once. A memory-bounded online solution. This idea might sound intuitive—but making it work rigorously requires careful theoretical treatment. In fact, prior literature provided no guarantees that NCC would remain optimal or even valid when applied to a dynamic graph structure. The correctness of our online extension hinges on two important observations:	1. 	Temporal ordering of fragments: Fragments arrive (roughly) in chronological order. That is, newly added fragments typically correspond to objects that appear later in time. 	2. 	Temporal locality of matching: If a fragment isn’t matched within a short temporal window (e. g. , 5 minutes), the chance it will match with future fragments is negligible. These observations are not just heuristics—they give our graph some special structures to allow the NCC algorithm to work efficiently:  Observation 1 ensures that adding a fragment preserves the structure of the residual graph—no past decisions are invalidated.  Observation 2 justifies the safe deletion of older fragments and their edges without violating flow feasibility or missing potential matches. In more technical terms, optimality is preserved at every step. Each update maintains flow conservation, and the negative cycle condition (the optimal condition) still holds after each fragment insertion and deletion. This guarantees that each iteration improves—or at least maintains—the global objective. Every update will remain optimal. The proof is here. Elegant. The results: As you might expect, the runtime scales linearly with the input rate. In practice, this means that by enforcing an upper bound on the temporal window (e. g. , five minutes), we can cap the graph size to approximately 2,000 nodes—corresponding to around 1,000 active fragments at any given time. MOT is only a part of the data processing pipeline. Full details see this paper. Under this configuration, the system processes 6,000 fragments in about one minute. A full hour of data—roughly 200,000 fragments—takes approximately 33 minutes to process end-to-end. This effectively makes the algorithm “online” in practical terms, as the processing time consistently stays below the real-time data accumulation rate. Of course, MOT is just one stage of a much larger system. In production, we integrated additional components including parallelized I/O for reading and writing to databases, as well as a post-processing step for smoothing trajectories. The system was built in Python using asynchronous scheduling to orchestrate real-time processing across multiple stages efficiently. Final thoughts: the art of real-time design: In the age of data streams, reliability meets responsiveness at the algorithmic level. When moving an established algorithm to the online version, certain theoretical properties may not hold. Nevertheless, they can still benefit practical deployment. In our case, the deletion part of the graph was technically not proved to be truth, but in practice it’s observed to be not impacting the performance. In the end, it’s a balance of theoretical precision and real-world constraints. If you’re building systems where object association matters—whether it’s traffic, inventory, or people—this kind of real-time thinking pays dividends.

    "body": "2022/08/05 - Vehicle trajectory data has received increasing research attention over the past decades. With the technological sensing improvements such as high-resolution video cameras, in-vehicle radars and lidars, abundant individual and contextual traffic data is now available. However, though the data quantity is massive, it is by itself of limited utility for traffic research because of noise and systematic sensing errors, thus necessitates proper processing to ensure data quality.  YouTube: I-24 MOTION data postprocessing algorithms We draw particular attention to extracting high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from video cameras as traffic monitoring cameras are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. We explore methods for automatic trajectory data reconciliation, given “raw” vehicle detection and tracking information from automatic video processing algorithms. We propose a pipeline including a) an online data association algorithm to match fragments that are associated to the same object (vehicle), which is formulated as a min-cost network flow problem of a graph, and b) a trajectory reconciliation method formulated as a quadratic program to enhance raw detection data. The pipeline leverages vehicle dynamics and physical constraints to associate tracked objects when they become fragmented, remove measurement noise on trajectories and impute missing data due to fragmentations. The accuracy is benchmarked on a sample of manually-labeled data, which shows that the reconciled trajectories improve the accuracy on all the tested input data for a wide range of measures. An online version of the reconciliation pipeline is implemented and will be applied in a continuous video processing system running on a camera network covering a 4-mile stretch of Interstate-24 near Nashville, Tennessee.

    "body": "2021/11/18 - This work explores the state estimation problem for heterogeneous traffic (a multiclass flow composed of vehicles with distinct sizes and driving behaviours) usingparticle filtering (PF) approaches. We consider three enhanced variations of thebootstrap PF to improve estimation. The benchmark PF utilises a deterministicpartial differential equation and an additive process noise that is state-independent. For the enhanced variations we first consider a parameter-adaptive PF that alsoallows model parameters to be adjusted. The second variation is a standard PFwith spatially-correlated noise. The last variation combines parameter-adaptive andthe spatially-correlated-noise approaches. We compare the four filters in numericalexperiments that represent complex heterogeneous traffic scenarios, as well as onreal-world heterogeneous traffic data. The results show that the enhanced filters canachieve up to an 80% and 46% of accuracy improvement as compared to an openloop simulation without measurement correction, with the synthetic settings andwith real traffic data, respectively. Moreover, the enhanced filters outperform thestandard PF in all the traffic scenarios based on accuracy. Resources:  Estimation for heterogeneous traffic using enhanced particle filters"

However, personalization components, as a mean to make the current technologies more acceptable and trustworthy for users, have been gaining momentum only very recently. In my recent work with Toyota InfoTech Labs, we aim to learn personalized longitudinal driving behaviors via a Gaussian Process (GP) model. The proposed method learns from individual driver’s naturalistic car-following behavior, and outputs a desired acceleration profile that suits the user’s preference. The learned model, together with a predictive safety filter that prevents rear-end collision, is used as a personalized adaptive cruise control (PACC) system. Numerical experiments show that GP-based PACC (GP-PACC) can reproduce the driving styles of human drivers up to 80% more accurately than baseline models (i. e. , optimal velocity model and intelligent driver model). Additionally, GP-PACC is further validated by human-in-the-loop experiments on the Unity game engine-based driving simulator. Trips driven by GP-PACC and two other baseline ACC algorithms with driver override rates are recorded and compared. Results show that all drivers override the GP-PACC less frequently, indicating drivers trust GP-PACC more than other ACC algorithms. "

Autonomous vehicle (AV) research and development has achieved a similar status in terms of money invested, societal excitement, and media coverage as space travel and exploration. At the same time, AV research is not rocket science; it is more complicated: while in itself, an AV is no more complex than a spacecraft, it must reliably interact and communicate with many other agents, particularly humans both inside and outside of the vehicle, much of it in a decentralized fashion. Hence, AVs, and their impact on us humans and our transportation systems, incur some of the most complicated science and engineering challenges that we shall face in the near future. At the same time, there is some disconnect across the various research communities: professional product development is highly opaque, and public expectations and media communications are frequently inaccurate or exaggerated. This long program aims to address these problems by connecting research communities, bridging gaps between theory and practice, exposing software experts to hardware and vice versa, and bringing mathematicians, other scientists, and engineers together to shape the research and development agenda on AVs, both in terms of individual and holistic components. Key mathematical themes in this program are:•  Robustness of machine learning•  Connecting micro and the macro scales•  Reinventing traffic flow theory in a non-local world•  Multi-agents systems, sparse controls, distributed leaders•  Fleet optimization and routing in a fully connected world•  Mathematics of societal impact of AVs "

The question of parameter identifiability of such models (i. e. , whether it is possible to infer its unknown parameters from the experimental data) is a central system analysis question, and yet still remains open. We present both structural and practical parameter identifiability analysis on four common car-following models: (i) the constant-time headway relative-velocity (CTH-RV) model, (ii) the optimal velocity model (OV), (iii) the follow-the-leader model (FTL) and (iv) the intelligent driver model (IDM). The structural identifiability analysis is carried out using a differential geometry approach, which confirms that, in theory, all of the tested car-following systems are structurally locally identifiable, i. e. , the parameters can be uniquely inferred under almost all initial condition and admissible inputs by observing the space gap alone. In a practical setting, we propose an optimization-based numerical direct test to determine parameter identifiability given a specific experimental setup (the specific initial conditions and input are known). The direct test conclusively finds distinct parameters under which the CTH-RV and FTL are not identifiable under the given initial condition and input trajectory. "

However, fine-grained city-scale data analysis is complicated by common, tedious data cleaning tasks such as removing outliers and imputing missing data. To address the challenge of data cleaning, this article introduces a robust low-rank tensor factorization method to automatically correct anomalies and impute missing entries for high-dimensional urban environmental datasets. We validate the method on a synthetically degraded National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration temperature dataset, with a recovery error of 4%, and apply it to the Array of Things city-scale sensor network in Chicago, IL.

The methods are also assessed on empirical data collected from a 2019 model year ACC vehicle driven in a highway environment. Speed, space gap, and relative velocity data are recorded directly from the factory-installed radar unit via the vehicle’s CAN bus. The least-squares method has the fastest run-time performance, and is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than other methods. The particle filter is faster than real-time, and therefore is suitable in streaming applications in which the datasets can grow arbitrarily large. "

The chapter later changed the name to Engineers in Action Bridge Program. Throughout my two years leadership in this group full of dedicated and compassionate young professionals, we built two pedestrian footbridges in the underserved communities in Guatemala and Panama. The successful constructions enable more than 1200 people to have safe access to local school, markets and clinics.  I’m so glad that the bridge team continues thriving after I graduated from UIUC. During the summers in 2018 and 2019, the team traveled to Bolivia for the third and fourth bridge projects. I’m proud of what they’ve brought to the local communities. Our contribution was recognized by the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at UIUC. The interview and story was published on the CEE department magazine and website.
