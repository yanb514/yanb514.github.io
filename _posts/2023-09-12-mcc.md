Multi-object tracking (MOT) or global data association problem is commonly approached as a minimum-cost-flow or minimum-cost-circulation problem on a graph. While there have been numerous studies aimed at enhancing algorithm efficiency, most of them focus on the batch problem, where all the data must be available simultaneously to construct a static graph. However, with the growing number of applications that generate streaming data, an efficient online algorithm is required to handle the streaming nature of the input. In this paper, we present an online extension of the well-known negative cycle canceling algorithm for solving the multi-object tracking problem with streaming fragmented data. We provide a proof of correctness for the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency through numerical experiments.
