I will be giving a presentation at SRI2025, session on "Solutions for Sustainable Transport & Mobility Systems", organized by the NSF-UKRI Clean Energy and Equitable Transportation Solutions (CLEETS) Global Center. Iâ€™ll be sharing some recent work with Argonne National Lab and Vanderbilt University on V2X and what it means to deploy them at scale. 

Looking forward to connecting with everyone!
