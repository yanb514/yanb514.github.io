I am extremely honored to received my 5th DDETFP Fellowship funded by USDOT, which gave me an opportunity to travel to TRB. This is my best TRB experience since 5 years ago. I presented our team work on the I-24 MOTION testbed during a poster session organized by the Information Systems and Technology committee, and another poster session organized by the DDETFP committee.
