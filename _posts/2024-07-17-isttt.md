I recently had the pleasure of attending the 25th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT25), hosted at the University of Michigan. The symposium brought together a vibrant international community of researchers focused on traffic flow theory, and it was inspiring to engage with so many experts under one roof.

A particular highlight was the opportunity to tour the famous MCity test facility and the autonomous vehicle lab led by Prof. Henry Liu.

Many thanks to Junyi Ji for making this experience possible.
