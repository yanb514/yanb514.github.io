This year marked my seventh time attending the Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting—and my first as a faculty member! The event continues to evolve, with noticeable changes introduced by the new administration, yet it remains an invaluable opportunity for reconnecting with long-time colleagues and forming new connections across the field.

I had the opportunity to attend an information session on ARPA-I and several insightful panels hosted by the USDOT Volpe Center. I also had the pleasure of presenting a poster, in collaboration with Felipe de Souza, on our ongoing work to develop a “digital corridor.”
