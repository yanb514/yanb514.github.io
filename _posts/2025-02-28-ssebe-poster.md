My MS student, Raswanth Prasath, presented his work titled “Enhancing Multi-Object Tracking” at the 15th Annual SSEBE Graduate Poster Symposium at ASU. Impressively, he shared preliminary results just 1.5 months into the project! An exciting start to a promising line of research.

Great job, Raswanth!
