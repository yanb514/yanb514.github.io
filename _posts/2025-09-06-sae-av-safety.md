In collaboration with Jeff Wishart, I co-authored an SAE technical report synthesizing safety evidence from NHTSA, IIHS/HLDI, SHRP2, and insurance datasets to assess the crash reduction potential of active safety and automated driving systems (SAE Levels 1–5). The report offers an industry-focused analysis of technology deployment trends, efficacy studies, and human–machine interaction challenges. It identifies key research gaps and provides guidance for regulators, automakers, and insurers on the benefits and limitations of ADAS and AV technologies.
