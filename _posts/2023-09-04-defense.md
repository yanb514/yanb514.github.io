I have successfully defended my PhD thesis in title "Reconstruction of mixed traﬀic systems at micro and macro scales" on September 4, 2023! The dissertation includes recent work on trajectory post processing that is implemented in the I-24 MOTION software pipeline. 

Thank you Prof. Work and other committee members for your support!
