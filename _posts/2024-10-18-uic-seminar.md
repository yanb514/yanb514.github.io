I was thrilled to visit the University of Illinois Chicago and deliver a seminar on ["Advancing Transportation Systems with Sensing and Digital Twins: A Case Study on Interstate-24"][link]. It was a pleasure to share my research and engage in thoughtful discussions with faculty and students.

Many thanks to Prof. Jane Lin for the kind invitation and generous hosting!
