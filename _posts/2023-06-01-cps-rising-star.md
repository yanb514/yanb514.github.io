I'm super honored to be awarded one of the CPS Rising Stars in 2023! 

The 2023 CPS Rising Stars Workshop was hosted by UVA Engineering Link Lab and was sponsored by National Science Foundation (NSF), Leidos, and SIGBED. 30 students from 23 different universities across the country traveled for a full-day workshop to learn about to successfully navigate the academic job search process and gain insight about the early stages of careers in academia. Additionally the workshop provided a unique opportunity to network with their peers and open the door to future collaborations and professional support.
