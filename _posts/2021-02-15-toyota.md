During my time at Toyota, I worked on personalizing adaptive cruise control in a vehicle. We collected vehicle-following-behavior data associated with a particular driver, trained a Gaussian Process (GP) Regression model using the collected vehicle-following-behavior data to produce a set of adaptive-cruise-control (ACC) parameters pertaining to the particular driver. The set of ACC parameters modeling learned vehicle-following behavior of the particular driver. It generates an acceleration command for the vehicle based, at least in part, on the set of ACC parameters. We also applied a predictive safety filter to the acceleration command to produce a certified acceleration command that has been vetted for safety. It allows control acceleration of the vehicle automatically in accordance with the certified acceleration command to regulate a following distance between a lead vehicle and the vehicle in accordance with the learned vehicle-following behavior of the particular driver.
