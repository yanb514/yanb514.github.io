I was invited by my friend Kelsey McCunney from Mass General Brigham to chat with Boston Public School students who interned at Mass General Hospital for the summer. They offer a “Summer Jobs Program” where students who are interested in pursuing a career in STEM have the opportunity to work in various departments of the hospital.
