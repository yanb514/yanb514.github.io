This Congestion Impacts Reduction via CAV-in-the-loop Lagrangian Energy Smoothing (CIRCLES)project aims to reduce instabilities in traffic flow, called "[phantom][phantom] jams," that cause congestion and wasted energy. If you have ever encountered a temporary traffic jam for no apparent reason, this might have been a phantom jam that occurred naturally because of human driving behavior.

[Prior work][dissipation] on closed-course testing demonstrated that phantom jams can be reduced using autonomous vehicle technologies and specially-designed algorithms. The CIRCLES project seeks to extend this technology to real-world traffic, where reducing these negative traffic effects could provide â‰¥10% energy savings.
