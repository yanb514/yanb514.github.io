I'm thrilled to announce that I have been awarded the Sidney P. Colowick Graduate Scholarship at Vanderbilt University! This prestigious scholarship is granted to only three graduate students campus-wide.

The Sidney P. Colowick Graduate Student Scholarship award provides financial support for a student selected as the most outstanding candidate from among those selected to receive Harold Stirling Vanderbilt (HSV) graduate scholarship.

The Sidney P. Colowick Graduate Student Scholarship was established February 1985 by Sidney Harshman to memorialize Sidney P. Colowick, who served as a professor of microbiology and an American Cancer Society professor at Vanderbilt University.
