I had an incredible three-month experience working at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory (MERL) in historic Cambridge, MA. During my time there, I collaborated with Dr. Marcel Menner and Dr. Karl Berntorp on a road monitoring project using crowdsourced vehicle data.

Despite the winter weather, I maintained a six-mile daily bike commute and enjoyed even longer rides on weekends to explore the Boston area. This routine not only kept me active but also allowed me to indulge in Dunkin' Donuts guilt-free.
