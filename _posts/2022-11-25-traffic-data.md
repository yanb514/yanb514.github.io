Last week, 100 Nissan Rogues with customized AI algorithms helped to smooth the traffic waves on a busy stretch of Nashvilleâ€™s I-24 during the morning commute. The experiment is a project of the CIRCLES consortium, a group that includes several automakers and the U.S. Energy and Transportation departments. Other lead researchers are based at the University of California, Berkeley; Temple University; and Rutgers University-Camden and Vanderbilt.

In parallel, as the drivers traversed their route, we collected traffic data from both the vehicles and the I-24 MOTION traffic monitoring system. On Nov. 16 alone, the system recorded a total of 143,010 miles driven and 3,780 hours of driving. The I-24 MOTION system, combined with vehicle energy models developed in the CIRCLES project, will provide an estimation of the fuel consumption of the whole traffic flow during those hours.
