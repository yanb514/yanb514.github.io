On March 25, 2025, ASU SSEBE had the pleasure of hosting colleagues from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI) for a lunch meeting. The visiting group included Vladimir Livshits, Bob Hazlett—both, Kevin Hall and Bill Eisele.

The meeting focused on exploring opportunities for collaboration between ASU and TTI, with a shared interest in pursuing large-scale transportation research initiatives. ASU faculty presented some recent work on NCIT, travel behavior dashboard and traffic operations.

We’re excited about the potential for impactful partnerships ahead and look forward to future engagement with TTI.
