On May 6, 2025, I had the pleasure of welcoming the Data and Analytics group from the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) to the ASU campus. The visit was joined by several faculty members from the School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment (SSEBE), who shared exciting ongoing research.

Our presentations covered a range of topics, including connected and automated vehicle (CAV)-based traffic control, smart and safe work zones, transportation planning, and travel behavior analysis.

We’re enthusiastic about the potential for impactful collaborations with MAG and look forward to building strong partnerships in the future.
