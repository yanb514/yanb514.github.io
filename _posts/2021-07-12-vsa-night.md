I was invited at  Vanderbilt Summer Academy, a pre-college residential program for rising 11th/12th grade students. The “expert night” is intended to offer VSA students a wide range of potential academic and career paths that sparks their imagination and widens their field of vision as they begin to think about aligning their passion and future work.
