The 4th Modeling, Estimation, and Control Conference (MECC 2024) took place this year in Chicago, and I had the pleasure of presenting in the Invited Session on Automotive and Transportation Systems (ATS). It was a great opportunity to share my work and engage with researchers advancing the frontiers of modeling and control in all engineering disciplines.

Grateful for the chance to contribute and connect with colleagues in this community.
