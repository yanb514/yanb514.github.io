The I-24 MOTION team hosted a successful data tutorial and workshop during the Transportation Research Board 2024 Annual Meeting. This was an opportunity to hear about the project and the data it produces, work hands-on with the data with help from the development team, and discuss research ideas and use cases with the team. The workshop was held Wednesday, January 10, 2:00-5:30pm at Open Gov Hub meeting space, 1100 13th St NW STE 800, Washington, D.C., 20005.
