I occasionally provide pro bono, small-scope, and fast-turnaround consulting for external partners interested in making better use of complex, real-world data—particularly in transportation and adjacent domains. These engagements are intended to foster collaboration, explore practical challenges in data science, and broaden the real-world impact of my technical expertise.

Typical engagements may include:

- A no-cost, 30-minute discovery call to understand your data or analytics challenge
- A lightweight data audit – You provide sample data or API access, and I return insights, visualizations, and recommendations (typically within 2 weeks, or 16 hours)
- Proof-of-concept prototype - a minimal, illustrative demo to visualize early-stage ideas or strategies
- Optional follow-up discussions – to help teams frame next steps, refine use cases, or plan roadmap development

**Who might benefit**

This service is a good fit for public- and private-sector teams seeking technically informed, low-overhead feedback—without committing to long-term consulting engagements. Example clients include:

- Public agencies exploring how to leverage mobility or infrastructure data
- Transportation/logistics firms rethinking operational questions
- Insurance companies exploring risk, behavior, or vehicle telematics data
- Startups validating a data-driven MVP or looking to prototype live dashboards
- Innovation and R&D teams working on IoT, sensing, or edge/real-time analytics

I am especially interested in early-stage or exploratory projects where strategic thinking and minimal modeling can make a big difference quickly.

**Important notes & disclaimers**

This consulting work is conducted independently of my academic role at Arizona State University. This work is not affiliated with or endorsed by ASU, and no university resources, branding, or student labor are involved. In accordance with ASU policy, all consulting activities are disclosed through the university’s Conflict of Interest (COI) reporting process. Time spent on these efforts complies with university limits on outside activities (typically capped at 1 day per week during the academic year).
